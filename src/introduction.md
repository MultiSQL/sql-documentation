# Introduction
MultiSQL is a highly modular SQL database engine library written in Rust. It enables flexible querying via Rust interfaces.


This documentation describes the available functions, x and syntax of MultiSQL.

Note that MultiSQL uses [sqlparser-rs](https://github.com/sqlparser-rs/sqlparser-rs) for SQL parsing and as such their syntax is ours.

They try to follow SQL:2016 standards.
